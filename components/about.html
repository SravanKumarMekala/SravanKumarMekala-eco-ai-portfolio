            Hello! I'm Sravan Kumar Mekala, a passionate web developer with a keen eye for creating dynamic and
            engaging digital experiences. My journey into web development started with a curiosity for how websites
            work, which quickly blossomed into a love for crafting clean, efficient, and user-friendly code. I
            specialize in front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a growing interest in modern
            frameworks and libraries.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            I enjoy transforming complex problems into elegant solutions and constantly seek to learn new technologies
            and best practices. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new design trends or contributing to
            open-source projects. I'm always eager to take on new challenges and collaborate on exciting ventures.
